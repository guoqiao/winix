# Winix

Work on Windows like on Unix/Linux.

Target Users: Unix/Linux users, but have to use Windows some how.

# Usage

- checkout this repo to your disk, such as `D:\winix`
- add `D:\winix\bin` to your `Path` envvar.

To change envvar on Windows:

Settings -> System -> About -> Advanced system settings -> Environment Variables

Or just run this cmd:

```
bin\edit-env-vars.cmd
```

Please note, `Path` envvar exists in both `User variables for xxx` and `System variables`.

For this project, you only need to change the user one.
